# Purpose
Control your LIFX smart lights through a simple webpage; solve the issue of managing lights from a desktop computers where no apps are available/require multiple clicks.

# Pre-requisites
1. Use LIFX lights connected to the internet: https://www.lifx.com/collections/all
2. Generate a LIFX personal token to log in to your account.

# Setup
Nothing to setup or install! Just navigate to the home page, enter your personal key and all your lights will appear.

# Usage
The app allows you to turn on/off connected lights, change their colour and brightness level. If a device is turned off at the light switch level (or doesn't have access to the internet), the light will be marked offline
There are 2 tabs: Rooms and All lights.

* Rooms show the lights grouped by rooms setup in your app. You can control lights individually or a whole room at a time
* All lights simply display all the lights with the same individual features

# Notes
This app does not allow the management of lights (setup, renaming, moving room...). Use the offical LIFX apps for this
